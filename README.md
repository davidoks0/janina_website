# Personal Website for Janina Branke

This is a simple static personal website built with HTML and CSS.

## Deployment to Vercel

1.  **Sign up or Log in to Vercel:**
    Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and create an account or log in.

2.  **Connect your Git Repository:**
    -   Push this project (the `index.html`, `style.css`, and this `README.md` file) to a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    -   In Vercel dashboard, click on "Add New..." -> "Project".
    -   Import the Git repository you just created.

3.  **Configure Project (Optional):**
    -   Vercel should automatically detect that this is a static site (no specific framework).
    -   The Root Directory should be the base of your repository.
    -   Build Command and Output Directory can usually be left blank or with default settings for a simple static site.

4.  **Deploy:**
    Click the "Deploy" button.

Your website will be deployed, and Vercel will provide you with a URL.
